 Design Ideas for the Hackathon
</div>

<div id='main'>

<h2>Here are some design ideas, opinions and goals for the webkit demos... everything is up for discussion</h2>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Motivation: There is a gap in the 'market' for a good CSS3 webkit demo site</h2>

<p>The CSS3 webkit extensions offer some great functionality but existing tutorial/documentation sites don't offer 
	much help to either newbie programmers or designers.</p>

<p>Sites either list out the sytax in detail or show complex 'showcase' examples. We need a series of simple clean 
	examples that show each extension in isolation and in simple combinations.</p>

<p>In particular, 3D transformations can be confusing if you've not been exposed to them before.</p>


<h2>Simple Examples are a Good Thing</h2>

<p>Basic demo pages should only use HTML and CSS, avoiding JavaScript as far as possible.</p>

<p>There should be no requirement for a server unless really necessary.</p>

<p>Users should be able to download a demo page, see what is going on and modify it without having to read through extraneous cruft.</p>



<h2>Goal for the Hackathon Timeframe</h2>

<p>Focus on visual effects properties/extensions - but go for it if you want to work on other features.</p>

<p>Get a basic site up, running and <i>deployed</i>... if it's in Google's search index by the end of the hackathon, that's a win</p>

<p>Create working demos for as many webkit extensions/properties as possible with all of them linked back to, at least,
	a stub of documentation.</p>

<p>Don't worry about browser compatability for now - other sites cover that - and creating demos is more fun given the 
	time available.</p>
		
<p>Build out more substantial demos that combine features if time allows.</p>

<p>Discuss whether this should exist as a standlone site, or whether it could be merged into an existing resource</p>


<h2>Mechanics</h2>

<p>Use <a href="http://pages.github.com/">GitHub Pages</a> to deploy the site ? - easy, immediate</p>

<p>Use template pages for each demo if possible - minimal styling, consistent look</p>

<p>Use syntax highlighting Javascript - e.g. <a href="http://alexgorbatchev.com/SyntaxHighlighter/">Alex Gorbatchev's SyntaxHighlighter</a> ?</p>
